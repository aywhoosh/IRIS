# IRIS App Changes Tracking

## UI/UX Enhancements (2023)

### Aurora Background Improvements
- Adjusted aurora colors to align with medical aesthetic
- Reduced intensity for a more subtle, soothing effect
- Implemented dynamic aurora colors based on detected eye conditions:
  - Healthy eyes: Green-tinted aurora
  - Mild conditions (e.g. cataracts): Yellow/amber aurora
  - Severe conditions (e.g. glaucoma): Red aurora
  - Default: Blue/cyan aurora (matching IRIS app icon)
- Added smoother transitions between colors

### Image Upload Flow Optimization
- Streamlined gallery image selection by directly opening the image picker from Home Screen
- Eliminated redundant gallery upload screen step
- Added better error handling for image selection
- Improved permission handling for Android 13+ (READ_MEDIA_IMAGES)

### Processing Screen Improvements
- Added aurora background that dynamically changes color as condition is detected
- Improved user feedback during processing
- Simplified UI for better focus on the processing status

### Scan History Feature
- Implemented scan history screen accessible from home page
- Added scan history button with appropriate medical app color scheme
- Created scan history tile layout with eye photo on left and condition details on right
- Added ability to view and delete past scans

### Button and Text Visibility Fixes
- Corrected text visibility issues in buttons
- Added explicit foreground colors to ensure text is visible
- Fixed disabled state styling for buttons
